# SCTP_NKE_ElCapitan
A version of the SCTP NKE running on Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan)

Starting with Mac OS X 10.11, you can't load unsinged kernel extensions anymore without
disabling the System Integrity Protection.
See [Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/System_Integrity_Protection_Guide/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection/ConfiguringSystemIntegrityProtection.html) on how to disable it.
I'm currently not providing an signed NKE, since I don't have the necessary certificate yet.
