# SCTP NKE for Mac OS X 10.14 (Mojave)

This is a modified version based on https://github.com/sctplab/SCTP_NKE_HighSierra
Its modification are to make it work for Mojave 10.14 and produce a installer.
The library is installed as MacOS X framework in /Library/Frameworks so you can easily link to it.

The package binary is signed and notarized so it runs also on 10.14.5 and above
